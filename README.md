# Avalanche Tokenlists
Tokenlists for the Trader Joe and other DEXes.

## Guidelines
- Logos are welcome. 
- Tokenlist requests are approved by JOE team based on market demand and other metrics. 

## Contributions
### Adding Your Token Logo
Token logos are in the `./logos` folder. Please add `300X300` logo as `./logos/<address>/logo.png`

### Adding Your Token to an Existing List
Go ahead and submit a PR. Format must match the standard tokenlist format: https://github.com/Uniswap/token-lists.

Tokens must be added to a list that they qualify for. List requirements:

1. Joe: Top popular Avalanche-native project tokens. 
2. Zap: Token and LP pairs available for 1-click zap. (TBD)
